# Pythonista

A Python skeleton project

## Setup

To create a new project based on this skeleton, create a new directory with the name of your project, and inside of it, run:

```
git init
git pull [this repo]
make test
git commit -am "Initial version"

```

This will initialize the directory and change all the project references inside it. 

## Usage

   * Write tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html)
   * Run tests with [pytest-watch](https://github.com/joeyespo/pytest-watch)
   * Manage dependencies with [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
   * Run `make` for help on other tasks
